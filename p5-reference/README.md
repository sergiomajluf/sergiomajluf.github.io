P5 Reference
======================

I begun translating Processing's reference pages into P5.js syntax.

Not everything have yet been ported into the library. There are also some new things in P5.js that dont' exist in Processing.

But **most of the functionalitites are the same**, and it's only a slight difference in syntax.
##What is this repository?:
	This is a list of links for each object/method/function supported by P5.js, and it's corresopnding example page with working code samples.

Official reference and documentation:
